It is difficult to value art with no reasonable or robust track record in the secondary marketplace (i.e. at auction) nor with any historical pedigree. Yet the market for contemporary art works has far surpassed many other categories of collecting, including Impressionist and Modern art. This course looks at the dynamics at play in the contemporary art marketplace. Through a combination of case studies, as well as structural and statistical analysis, students will unpack the contemporary art market, while comparing it to markets for other goods (real estate, luxury goods, and commodities)."

cultural context. Students will become familiar with basic concepts and qualitative methods in the 
social sciences, including ethnographic fieldwork and the analysis of face-to-face communication. 
We look for ways of answering questions such as these:

• How do everyday conversational practices create solidarity between people, or set them apart from 
one another? How does talk reflect and create relations of power?
• How do words combine with other semiotic modalities (gesture, facial expression, prosody) to 
convey subtle messages?
• Why do miscommunications arise, even between people who speak the same language?
• How do children learn to speak not only grammatically, but also appropriately?
• How does language shape our thoughts or the ways we perceive the world?

In this course, we explore language  as a complex form of social action—not merely a vehicle for 
communicating thoughts and meanings, but a means of creating the social world. We consider ways 
that language acts on us, and ways that we act through language: achieving relationships, 
constituting identities, constructing norms and patterns of thought, and positioning ourselves and 
others in relation to global systems of power and inequality.

We will begin by asking how analytical categories including the "Middle East" and "Muslim Women" tend to advance particular forms of knowledge production in the West. Taking as a point of departure the myriad voices that have "spoken for" women in the Middle East, this course will explore nationalism; colonization; veiling and the politics of appearance; anti-colonial revolution; human rights; religious identity and Islamic feminism; and exile, especially as expressed in literary memoir, critical theory and historiography, and film. We will focus on transnational feminist perspectives from the diaspora, paying particular attention to the experiences of women who have immigrated to North America and Europe in the wake of war and revolution, and who identify themselves as existing in the margins between nations. We will focus on women's experiences in Iran, Egypt and the Francophone Maghreb, especially Algeria. In conclusion, we will evaluate media coverage of the ongoing "Arab Spring" with respect to gender, sexual, ethnic, national and religious identities; the politics of solidarity: sexuality and/ as revolution; neo-Orientalism; post-9/11 Islamism; and the role of social media in the production and dissemination of cultures of dissent."

We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like "the market" and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

In contrast with most received narratives, we find making of the crisis primarily in the shaping of ethnic conflict and ehtno-national state-making by partition under British colonial rule -- not in timeless enmities. The course is also concerned to understand why the status quo of the present is at once so violently oppressive for Palestinians and eyt something many jewis Israelis and their state accept. We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo -- and how that may be changing.

The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior.

His film essay is an exorcism of the world, a melancholy, critical farewell-but Sans Soleil is also about the world, a visual celebration of that world: at once exorcism and homage; a leave-taking and a reverent, fine-grained representation. That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the "writing on the walls of the prison house of culture," a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a "matter of life and death." We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation.

Beginning in the eighteenth century, as major scientific developments were unfolding in Europe and the United States, these regions were engaging in colonial expansion in Africa, Asia and the Americas.

This course examines these intertwined historical processes and how they laid the foundations for medico-scientific research and practice today. Drawing on anthropological and historical texts, we examine key themes such as scientific racism, hygiene and morality, and the regulation of indigenous knowledges.

"Just the opposite," replies Faulques. "We are all a part of the monster that moves us around the chessboard." As Faulques—the painter/war-photographer protagonist in Perez-Reverte's novel The Painter of Battles—sees it, war and destruction and their attendant personal horrors are more ordinary, more typical of human beings than peace and civil order. But while chaos has its own rules and symmetries and nothing is coincidental or happens by chance, as spectators we are complicit in the occurrences of violent upheaval about which we read each day in The New York Times. We will investigate this premise. How do we explain war; what is it for? What does war do to us—distant or not-so-distant spectators—and to others—willing or unwilling participants? Is war endemic to the human condition? Is it a necessary evil? Does it emerge from psychologi­cal and irrational "drives," or from economic, rational considerations?

This seminar takes an anthropological approach to knowledge and knowledge-making practices; it explores connections between rationality and culture. We will ask how and where, in which kinds of practices, "scientific rationality" -- as we will call it for the moment -- is "located." What is it about this kind of rationality that is so compelling? Are other kinds of rationalities thinkable, possible, or plausible? Are such other kinds of rationalities perhaps "at work" even as we speak, in parallel with, or embedded in, the ways in which scientists make knowledge? To answer thee questions, we will examine objectivity and calculatory logic -- the elements of "scientific rationality." Are objectivity and logic perhaps values as much as they are practices? We will then mine the anthropological literature for alternate logics than the ones we take for granted, examining magical thinking, belief, and indigenous practices that define for "us" what is "irrational." Are such practices perhaps less irrational than we assume them to be? Finally, we will take on actual scientific practices of knowledge-making, empirically and anthropologically. We may assume that rationality as we know it imbues such practices. But are they perhaps informed by alternate logics as well? Here is where subjectivity and affect come into our picture of what scientific practices are made of; we will try to give such alternate values a place in how the bodies that "do" science act, think, and make knowledge.

This will involve taking apart reified notions of regional or national "cultures" to instead consider how cultural practices are complex and fundamentally power-laden. We trace how social relations in Latin America take shape in light of legacies of colonialism, transatlantic slavery, mestizo nation-building, and more. Importantly, we consider what ethnographic approaches might tell us about everyday forms of living and self-making, as well as about political struggles over land, labor, and cultural recognition in the region."

By taking infrastructures seriously as processes that can be made to enable (or impede) certain kinds of relations or movements, as well as devices that can function as important symbolic projects, this class will raise a number of interrelated questions. What sorts of histories become apparent when looking at the emergence of particular kinds of infrastructures? How can we approach questions of environmental justice by studying the mundane infrastructures of daily life? Which communities are made more vulnerable to risk by particular kinds of infrastructure planning, and how can we address these questions using qualitative, ethnographic methods?

At the same time, an anthropological approach to biomedicine suggests that biomedical ideas and practices are always linked to political and economic interests and social values. This course examines the constitution and contestation of biomedical knowledge from a global perspective. Drawing on contemporary anthropological research, we will consider the specificity of biomedicine in relation to other forms of knowledge and belief about the body and its care.

Beginning with a familiar vantage point (say, the college campus), the course casts a wide net and asks, is what we call depression in the suburbs of Los Angeles fundamentally the same thing in Mumbai and in the rural areas of South Africa? What does the burgeoning number of children in the United States diagnosed with ADHD say about changes in American childhood and in the medical profession, in cultural understandings of the brain and of human behavior? How does the proliferating use of psychoactive drugs affect conceptions of the self and of well-being? This course examines, in short, the intersections of mental health with lived experience in a cross-cultural context, juxtaposing the writings of medical professionals with the narratives of those experiencing mental illness in the most varied circumstances from the residence halls in Claremont to the streets of Brazil. It introduces students to the idea that the science of mental health is itself a culturally informed and shifting terrain. Yet the course may also lead one to wonder whether certain manifestations of suffering and the desire for health are not also intrinsic to a shared human experience that transcends our moment in time and our most familiar surroundings."

The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists' inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper.

Given the rich and complex history of the Arab World, this course is positioned at the intersection of various disciplines and is interdisciplinary in nature. What are the sources of this diversity? How the cultural exchange of the Mediterranean sea at the crossroads of history made the region fascinating? Diversity in the Middle East undeniably contributed to civilization, yet the three monotheistic religions are not indifferent to this cultural exchange. As the question of cultural and religious diversity is at the heart of the political drama of the Middle East, the course will reflect on the future of the Middle East in the context of this diversity in light of history and politics."

Economic theories seem very abstract to many students because these theories usually assume many unrealistic things about people and society. Students must be mindful of the fact that these assumptions are what allow economists to answer many otherwise intractable questions. The results that we attain usually hold even without these simplifying assumptions.

"ASAM084  PZ","","ASAM084  PZ","Nonviolent Social Change","ZAAS","ZAAS","PZ","PZ","Asian American Studies emerged out of the longest student strike in the history of the United States.  The third world liberation front used nonviolent social protest to call for educational relevance and greater access to higher education.   With a critical analysis of oppression and imperialism, the 1968 Third World Strike led to the institutionalization of Ethnic Studies. As such, it is a natural extension that an Asian American Studies class examines the history, philosophy, and practice of nonviolent social change. Nonviolence is neither the absence of violence nor passively avoiding violence.  It is an active engagement with society in order to fight for justice and freedom for all humans. Mohandas Gandhi conceptualized nonviolence as soul-force or satyagraha to mobilize Indians to challenge British colonialism in the early 1900s. Cesar Chavez and Philip Vera Cruz deployed non-violent mobilization techniques with the United Farm Workers to bring together Chican@/Latin@ and Filipin@ agricultural workers to demand better labor conditions in the 1960s.  Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King, Jr., Thich Nhat Hanh approaches nonviolence as inter-being to organize social welfare and peace campaigns during the Vietnam War.  Drawing from Christian theology, Martin Luther King Jr. conceptualized nonviolence social change on the basis of agape during mass campaigns against Jim Crow laws in the racially segregated and virulent United States.

Held at the Pitzer-in-Ontario location, the class is a combined class with half from the Claremont Colleges and half from larger community in Ontario, CA. Under the rubric of political autobiography, this class examines the philosophy and practice of nonviolent social change through your political autobiography in order to identify, compare, and evaluate definitions of violence, nonviolence, and social justice.   In addition to course time with the combined class at Pitzer-in-Ontario, Claremont College students will work with and learn from a community partnership in Ontario affiliated with Pitzer-in-Ontario program: Huerte de Valle, Partners in Health, Inland Congregations United for Change, etc. If there are extenuating circumstances which impact ability to participate in a community project, then communicate with the professor early. 

This class is based on a participatory education model and so your commitment to be an active contributor is essential to the learning process for all.  The readings are in a smaller quantity but are dense theoretically.  The purpose is for students to read them closely multiple times before class and to be able extrapolate from them in class. Please bring your reading to class in order to be able to refer to it during discussions.   Moreover, this class is based on a mutually respectful relationship with the community partners and a social justice model of community-based learning.

The lectures and readings are meant to show that we have not simply let things happen to us, that we have not simply been reactionary. We have fought hard for and have contributed immensely to the formation of civil rights jurisprudence in our great nation. In addition, the class will attempt to tie in current events and contemporary issues to the past. From this critical analysis, students should leave the class with a better understanding of the current state of the Asian Pacific American community, although each student may (and probably will) have a different opinion on how the community should address current issues and concerns. The goal of the class is to instill critical thinking and historical understanding, not to impose one perspective on the law and public policy.

Writers seeking to reflect and inform the US immigrant experience have seized on the expressive and critical power of memoir, Bildungsromane, historical fiction, and revolution narratives. Reading the literature of Latinas of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin will show us how immigration and cicular migration inform issues of gender, sexuality, maternity, and reproduction.

With "Histories of the Present," Core I faculty and students will explore the relationship between historically informed critical thinking and our engagement with contemporary issues and debates. Our investigations seek to highlight the categories and values that we may take to be given or obvious and the ways in which the conventional or received understanding and application of these categories and values can prevent us from seeing ourselves and the world--social and natural--in other ways. 

Core I takes up this task through an examination of communities. Starting with the question "What is a community?" we look at both large imagined communities such as modern nation-states and religious groups and smaller, more intimate groups that we regularly label as a "community." We ask: How are communities formed and transformed? What role does historical memory and forgetting play in the creation of community? How are communities at once inclusive and exclusionary? What role do performance and memory play in the formation and transformation of communities? Any when are communities beneficial and when are they potentially harmful?

In this course, we examine the ways in which communities are created and transformed through political acts, religious practices, military intervention, cultural performances, social networks, and bonding. In conjunction with this, we critique the ways in which practices of overt and implicit exclusion along the lines of birth, class, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and religious beliefs limit the possibility of belonging. We explore the ways in which individuals and communities define and represent themselves in accordance with and in resistance to the dominant powers that often determine a community's boundaries. We also explore how communities work in resistance to transform their own and other's political, economic and social condition.

The less stylized forms are known in Egyptian dance training communities as Raqs Baladi (dance o the homeland - a social form that is sometimes staged), and as Shaabi (which translates to popular dance).  Each of these also are names given to musical styles, and we will use music from these and other styles to train in the Sharqi style.  This class requires no previous dance experience, and is designed to enhance the student's creative and physical awareness, and familiarize you with the basic movement vocabulary used in this dance form, and with the musical forms utilized in performance.

This course reviews key theories and methods to prepare sophomore and junior EA majors for senior-level work. This advanced seminar will facilitate your transition from being Environmental Analysis students to Environmental Analysis scholars who are prepared to conduct original research and/or engage with hands-on research and writing. We will read and discuss EA-based research with particular attention to the different methodological and theoretical approaches used in the field. The course is organized based on the most common types of evidence Environmental Analysis scholars
use in their research. Each week we will examine articles that use different types of evidence, including: archival documents; law and legislation; newspapers and magazines; photography; film; music; oral history, ethnography, and interviews; maps, spatial data, demographic data, and reports; and museum exhibitions, public history and memorials. We will also read a number of articles to better understand the ongoing debates over how “Environmental Studies” should be defined. Through readings and class discussions, as well as writing assignments, students will develop the analytical tools they need to begin their upper-level work in EA. Sophomore and Junior EA students are invited to
participate. "

It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting).

The course will pay particular attention to the agricultural class relations in an economy and its articulation with a global capitalist economy.

Marx's original hypotheses in Primitive Accumulation, which will be the starting point of the course, will then be problematized in the context of the works ofpost-Marxists such as Kautsky and Lenin's work on Agriculture, followed by an examination of the Japanese transition.

Better still, they may even share the same prize for saying completely opposite things. If this seems like a paradox, it is only because, it really is. What explains it?

The purpose of this course is to understand the evolution of ideas within economic thought and how they eventually led to different ways of theorizing in economics. In the introductory part of the course we will make an attempt to understand the relationship between the 'material world' and people's conceptualizations (or
'thoughts'/'theories') about them. Why do different people arrive at different conclusions while observing the same social phenomena? What is the purpose of
'theorizing'?  What set of factors lead to 'changes'  in the way we conceptualize, or think about the world around us?

Having explored these questions in the introductory part of the course, we will then visit the world of classical political economy via this lens and examine the theories and ideas of two of the greatest thinkers in classical political economy: Adam Smith and David Ricardo. This will be aided by understanding the influence of rational subjectivism and utilitarianism on economic thought. We will then examine the critique of classical political economy offered by Karl Marx. Our focus will be both on the 'essence' of this critique and also the set of circumstances that gave birth to it.

Finally, we will conclude the course by asking whether the critique is still valid in our times.

Recent work in behavioral economics uses experimental studies of how real people learn and behave to develop economic models of decision-making and performance. Behavioral game theory applies these techniques in settings with strategic interaction. Behavioral finance applies these techniques to decisions and performance in financial markets. The approach differs from the hyper-rational approach of standard new-classical theory by employing more realistic assumptions about how individuals acquire and use information about other individuals and the environment. The models have the potential to explain phenomena that neo-classical theory has difficulty explaining and provide more accurate predictions that can inform firm strategy and public policy. The course is aimed primarily at Ph.D. and M.A. students in Economics, but should also appeal to those from Politics and Policy or Management who have some previouse exposure to economics.

This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one "body" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few)  across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of "affordance" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the "vivid" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception."

Sterne's anticipation of 20th century formal innovations are worked through at midterm, and our reading of three paired authors--Defoe and Coetzee, Pope and Nabokov, Austen and a contemporary bestselling novelist--explores a field of possibilities.  Complications ensue.  Cervantes rewrites his own novel in the second part of Don Quixote.  Henry and Helen Fielding prove not brother and sister!  Colin Firth is cast as Darcy in both the BBC Pride and Prejudice and the big-screen adaptation of Bridget Jones.

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project?  What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an  "unfinished event?" The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays.

His film essay is an exorcism of the world, a bitter, critical farewell…but Sans Soleil is also about the world, a visually stunning celebration of that world: at once exorcism and homage; a leave-taking and a reverent, fine-grained representation. That is the tension inherent in the form of the essay, a global, politically and culturally rich non-fiction form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world, and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of thinking, writing, photographing, filming. Since its inception in the sixteenth century, the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the "writing on the walls of the prison-house of culture," a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a "matter of life and death." We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in both literature and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be working across disciplines and media, thinking about the relationship between representation, authority, aesthetics, and writing, photography, and film.  Assignments will be both written and visual; you will learn to film, edit, and write for your own video or film essay.

He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: "she walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son's rhythm is different." A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called "How to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces." At the heart of the course was Barthes' concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of "individual rhythms" that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes' notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: "spaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living." How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we'll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to "content." Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M."

Bourgeois, every day, dour, realistic. Filled with very-long novels about banks and dinners. And then at the window, Frankenstein's creature; a spectral woman in the garden; a hyena with human hands; a revenant nun; a malevolent vampire. This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women's rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking."

This course investigates "dread" in 19th-C British literature, grappling with an array of historical fears about the future. Whereas Frankestein expresses anxieties about scientific innovation, Sweeney Todd manifests concern about London's industrialization, and Dracula and The War of the Worlds anticipate violent imperial expansion. How is dread portrayed in theses stories -- particularly through the frames of gender, class, and nationality? How is it experienced by readers, possibly inciting action in the real world? Ultimately, we will consider what these historical works can teach us about the events, situations, and people we dread in our own day and age. "

The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere 'throughout history, and across the globe' they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. ('Essay,' from the French verb 'essai,' to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create 'strange bridges' where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form's origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States.

Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology 'the folklore of white supremacy.' Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, 'desirable things' that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler's words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a 'type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.' Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences.

Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting?

Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)?

This course begins with the 18th century Middle East and its increasing encounter with the West. We will study the social and political grounds behind the demise of the Ottoman Empire and its consequences for the future development of the region. After exploring how Western expansion and imperialism affected the domestic development of countries in the region, we transition to the Middle East since World War I, examining the emergence of nationalism and nation-states, the origins and future of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the role of ethnic and religious minorities in political affairs. We then analyze the rise of political Islam, the Middle East since 9/11, and US presence in the region. We will conclude by exploring the recent popular protests in the Arab world and their implications for the fate of the region in the 21st century. Along the way, we ask questions such as these: How did increasing interactions with the West and emerging global trade since the 18th century influence the social and political structures of countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Iran? Why did nationalism and state formation differ from country to country in the region? And finally, what are the historical and intellectual origins of recent waves of popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa?"

From Europe our intellectual journey will take us to Palestine during the 19th and early 20th century. There we will examine the social, demographic, and political structure of Palestinian society and discuss historical events, intellectual debates, important documents, and covert and overt agreements that have come into being since the emergence of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

In contrast with most received narratives, we find making of the crisis primarily in the shaping of ethnic conflict and ehtno-national state-making by partition under British colonial rule -- not in timeless enmities. The course is also concerned to understand why the status quo of the present is at once so violently oppressive for Palestinians and eyt something many jewis Israelis and their state accept. We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo -- and how that may be changing. In the final section of the course we identify plausible futures for Palestine-Israel, and consider how a globally dispersed social justice movement can support the Palestinian struggle for equality and freedom -- and thereby foster a positive or just peace for all persons in Paletine and Israel.

Central to this debate is the religious (or not-so religious) intentions behind our so-called Founding Fathers, and their plans for our nation's religious establishment.  For some, the Founders were pious and devout men intent on constructing an explicitly Christian nation; for others, they were borderline atheists who envisioned a strict separation of church and state. The historical reality is much more complex than either side readily admits. Burdened by anachronism and oversimplification, this debate is in dire need of thoughtful historical exploration from several angles. This is the work we will perform in this course. We will not only examine and contextualize the complex, conflicting, and often changing views of the Founders themselves, but we will also trace the evolution of this debate from the Revolution to the present.

To understand this radical shift in the relations between the US and the Middle East (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), we will study and discuss events, ideas, and doctrines that have shaped the interactions between these countries since the mid-19th century. Along the way, we will examine key issues such as America's earliest cultural and educational engagement in the region, Cold War rivalries, oil, US military intervention in the region since the 1950s and its support of authoritarian governments, Arab Nationalisms, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the rise of Islamist Movements.

the word “slavery” with the enslavement and forced migration of African people to
the Americas in the early modern era. Though this course does not overlook the
momentous nature of this development in world history—and will thus examine it in
detail—it also seeks to broaden our knowledge of slavery and slave trading by
treating them as worldwide phenomena that date back to the classical age and
remain with us still today. Accordingly, this course will consider: the definition of
slavery and other forms of servile labor; the institutions and experiences of slavery
in diverse historical contexts, especially in Africa and South Asia; why Africans were
traded as slaves to the Americas and how this trade affected culture and society in
Africa; and, lastly, the continuation of human trafficking in the modern world after
the supposed “end of slavery.”"

Why did some colonies seek and win independence, and why not others? How do slave insurrections and native American wars for independence fit into the history of the revolutionary era?

Colombia, with a focus on the African Diaspora. Starting in 1791, the enslaved broke their chains in the Haitian Revolution and radically recast the promise of freedom in the Americas. Colombia is home to the second largest Black population in Latin America after Brazil, and Blacks have stood at the heart of its struggles for dignity across the course of the nation’s history.

Throughout the colonial era (1697 to 1791 in Haiti and the 1520s to 1810 in Colombia), the poor practiced marronage or escape from beneath the control of European slave elites and metropoles. Metaphorically, those who liberate themselves or break free are the maroon nations, the peoples who have built societies based upon egalitarianism and profound respect for the land. Ranged against them were elites closely tied to Europeans, at first, and then to the United States, up to the present.

Black Colombians have won rights to the land that are historic for all people in the African Diaspora in the hemisphere. The Black majority of Haiti has, in recent decades, twice elected a president who obeys the will of the poor, and that sort of political project has encountered the full wrath of foreign soldiers, extractive economic models, and U.S.-backed coups."

This reading seminar moves from the late antique to the contemporary world surveying the multiple ways in which scholars, jurists, geographers, philosophers, artists, and journalists conceptualized the political community. We will pay particular attention to the intersection between religion and politics in regions we now call the "Middle East". The aim of the course is to provide students with a new way to understand claims made by ISIS or other active groups who mobilize religious rhetoric in support of political aims by engaging in a deep historical analysis of notions of leadership and belonging in the Islamicate world. We will therefore explore notions of tolerance, processes and ideologies of exclusion, and become adept at assessing how "history" is now increasingly used to legitimize contemporary political positions. Significantly, this class pays close attention to the power of words to create worlds, both imagined and actual.

How can we track the long history of connectivities and of movement between South Asia and the rest of the world? How have such connections and migrations changed form over time, responding to and reshaping both local and global realities? This course seeks to answer these questions through tracking the multi-layered and ever-changing relationship between South Asia and the world from the thirteenth century to the present day. In doing so, it emphasizes the many forms of transregional connectivity extant throughout this period, including merchant networks, pilgrimage routes, diplomatic ties, empire, diasporas and shared languages, with a particular focus on migration. We will discuss a diverse range of individuals and communities, from indentured servants and African soldiers to Persian-speaking peripatetic elites and Jesuit missionaries, from colonial-era Anglophone Indian intellectuals and ayahs to contemporary migrant workers. Throughout the course we will explore multiple ways of understanding the â€œglobal,â€ while emphasizing its complex entanglements with the local, the regional, and the inter-regional.

Today Muslims from different ethnic, political, and social backgrounds constitute over 4 percent of the population of the European Union. The nearly century-long migration of an increasing number of guest workers, professionals, and asylum seekers to countries like Germany, France, Sweden, and Great Britain has established Muslims as a large minority in several EU countries. Yet the growing presence of Muslims in European societies in recent years due to escalating violent conflicts, imperialist intervention, sectarian rifts, and terrorist attacks, triggered heated debates about citizenship, racism, integration and the place of Islam and Muslims in Europe. It also gave rise to a growing right-wing mobilization and anti-Muslim animosity, with surprising similarities to the anti-Semitic propaganda of the past. In this course we will examine questions like this: What are the historical, economic, and political reasons for the migration of the Muslims to Europe? Why are some groups of Muslims in the EU integrated, while others are marginalized? Are Muslims equally represented in European democracies?

They will have the opportunity to directly apply this knowledge toward possible redress and reforms. In addition to weekly readings and discussions on the history of racial violence and injustice, students will be divided into research teams assigned to collect data for current legal investigations of police brutality, and to present research on historical crimes that have not been redressed such as slavery, the pattern of race riots (massacres) in Tulsa, Harlem, Detroit, Atlanta, Chicago, and the 2020 response to the murder of George Floyd. With the additional involvement of human rights lawyers affiliated with the Mgrublian Center, students will learn about qualified immunity, bodycam regulations and other hindrances to exposing and prosecuting violators. Campaigns led by BLM and the Innocence Project on the prison-industrial complex and other forms of institutionalized racism will be evaluated and students will be encouraged to analyze individual prisoner cases.

We will (1) use self-reflection to analyze, interpret, and make sense of student experiences in the field; and (2) articulate a clarified ethical framework by examining personal values, beliefs, and responsibilities in light of lessons learned in the field. Students’ needs, observations, and experiences in the community will guide the precise content and pacing of the course. Assignments will consist of reflective writing, in-class discussions, and public presentations. Short readings will be selected by the instructors and students to provide additional perspectives and theoretical lenses through which to understand our lived experiences. This 1-unit course meets once per week for 75-minutes. Enrolled students must have an active community engagement commitment (e.g., a volunteer position, co-curricular activity like Science Bus) of at least one hour per week.

The Color of Nonprofit Sector Leadership: Women, Race and Social Change

This course examines how women of color develop and sustain their capacity to create meaningful social change within the nonprofit ecosystem. How do these leaders adapt traditional, and modern, leadership and management models to embody 21st-century success? Passion and a strong desire to improve inequitable circumstances often leads to resilient, confident leaders, but what goes on "behind the veil?" With an intentionally race-based orientation, we will explore how intersectionality influences opportunity and capacity. We will aim to understand how established and aspiring leaders use asset based strengths such as culture, emotional intelligence, spirituality/faith, intuition, ethics, class, policy, power, and politics from a first person perspective.

Sunshine and Noir- Los Angeles Art and Architecture: 1957 to the Present

In recent years Los Angeles has risen to one of the most vibrant art cities in the world. After Paris and New York, Los Angeles has become a desirable production site with a young but increasingly strong history. Stereotypically it has been described as Eden and 'Helltown' or as Sunshine and Noir as Mike Davis famously stated in his book The City of Quartz. In an attempt to grasp Los Angeles' specificity, the class will take a look back at its artistic movements, institutions, and cultural shifts, and will provide a broad overview of art and architecture of the the second half of the last century.

Students will read and analyze fairy tales written between the Renaissance and today in relation to the cultural milieu in which they originated and their adaptations in other genres and literary traditions. While it is true that numerous fairy tales were initially aimed at spreading civic and familial values among children and young adults, we will examine how many also contributed to the construction and perpetuation of stereotypes, gender roles, and discrimination. In this course, we will discuss questions concerning the narratological and literary aspects of fairy tales, the relationship between fairy tales and national identity, and the reworking of older fairy tales and the production of new ones, in regard to contemporary culture and its aspirations and anxieties.

However, the centrality of food and the act of eating have been tackled long before and they have always played a pivotal role in Italian literature, as witnessed by their representations from Dante and Boccaccio to Dacia Maraini and Igiaba Scego. Depictions of food, and the many references to it, in Italian literature and cinema, carry more complex aesthetic and ethical messages that transcend the realm of the kitchen.  Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining "Italianess", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads. We will read short stories, poems, and prose extracts from but not limited to: Dante, Boccaccio, Giulio Cesare Croce, Pirandello, and Marinetti.

She and Walt Whitman-altogether different from one another--are the most canonical of American poets.  Her poems have come to stand for privacy, intensity, compression, and intellectuality.  She wrote in a meter familiar to all those who have sung hymns in Christian churches.  Her syntax and diction, though, are often peculiar, like that of no other English-language poet.

Paul Celan

This class will trace the career of Paul Celan (1920-1970), the most highly regarded German-language poet of the post-1945 era.  Celan's poems were written, almost entirely, in German.  Students who can read German are especially welcome, but we will read translations alongside the German texts.  Reading knowledge of German is desired but not required. German was Celan's first language, but in Czernowitz, where he grew up, Yiddish and Romanian were also spoken.  After the end of the War in 1945, he began to make his literary career in Germany.  In 1948, though, he moved to Paris and resided there until his death by suicide in 1970.  We'll read his early poems in relation to those of his lover the Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann, and consider their effort to participate in Group 47.  We will read selections from each of his volumes, and the efforts of some other poets to engage the subject of the Holocaust.  There are multiple translations of his poems into English, a very good biography in English, and several English-language critical studies of his work.  Students without German will find much scholarship available to help them with his difficult poetry.  Students will write three seven-page papers and give at least one class presentation.  Course grades will be determined on the basis of (1) the quality of students' writing, (2) the acuteness of their analyses, (3) and their class participation.

We will be reading approximately an act per week, taking into account not only broader matters of narrative, characterization, and thematization but also more minute matters of texture and performance: diction, meter, syntax, tone, pace, gesture, pauses, and silences.

This course is primarily about representations of blackness in Hollywood films. However, our study will pivot on the premise that it is foolish--if not impossible--to consider the history of representations of race in American cinema without also considering representations of gender. Recognizing that Hollywood's portrayals of racial blackness and whiteness are always bound to conceptions of masculinity and femininity, the course will focus on the historical evolution of the entanglement of race and gender as it charts the development of popular film-making in America since the early twentieth century. Using video-conferencing technology to facilitate weekly, seminar-style discussions of assigned texts, students from the Claremont Colleges will join together with a small cohort of Pitzer College students incarcerated at the California Rehabilitation Center. Although there are no prerequisites for enrollment in the course, students wishing to register must submit Perm Requests and respond to a questionnaire. 

Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.

Spring 2021: William Shakespeare’s Othello is having something of a "moment." It has been called the play that perfectly captures the issues and anxieties affecting our twenty-first century lives. His play about a black man who rises to the rank of general in the Venetian Army speaks to the possibilities of diversity and a meritocratic system in a multicultural society. However, Othello’s murder of his innocent Venetian wife points to the deadly danger of incorporating foreign others in the body politic. At the center of all interpretations of Othello is the question of race: how are we to understand and analyze Othello’s blackness, constructed, as it is, for a white audience and represented by a white author? Moreover, how does Othello’s blackness become transcendent, able to stand for the seemingly universal, negative associations that get attached to it in the western imaginary? In this course, we will question the premise that positions Shakespeare's play as offering a reflection of our own culture. In addition, we will consider the questions about who gets to write about and understand blackness, black people, and black experiences as we examine the literary and cultural intents and effects of Othello across the centuries. Beginning with Shakespeare, we will consider the way the play, its titular character, and anxieties about race and interracial desire haunt constructions of Africans, blackness, and African Americans in literature by a range of authors.

It became viral, however, in 2017 when prominent women in Hollywood began to share their stories of sexual exploitation and retaliation from the Hollywood (male) elite and then rapidly spread to various institutions and industries. Amid these very contemporary and pressing concerns, where then, might Shakespeare fit in? We know that sexism and patriarchy were not invented in the 21st century, they are seemingly, as old as human history and communities. Taking that as our starting point, in this course we will examine how Shakespeare’s work engages in concerns that we identify as being germane to those of #MeToo. Some of the questions we will be asking during the course include: how does an early modern playwright depict and interrogate notions of sexual violence, exploitation, and coercion? How does his work offer opportunities to intervene in a hyper-patriarchal and masculinist society? What opportunities do his plays suggest for women’s power and agency? Is there a way that we can use Shakespeare’s plays to comment on the sexual politics of our own era?

William Shakespeare's Othello is having something of a "moment." It has been called the play that perfectly captures the issues and anxieties affecting our twenty-first century lives. His play about a black man who rises to the rank of general in the Venetian Army speaks to the possibilities of diversity and a meritocratic system in a multicultural society. However, Othello's murder of his innocent Venetian wife points to the deadly danger of incorporating foreign others in the body politic. At the center of all interpretations of Othello is the question of race: how are we to understand and analyze Othello's blackness, constructed, as it is, for a white audience and represented by a white author? Moreover, how does Othello's blackness become transcendent, able to stand for the seemingly universal, negative associations that get attached to it in the western imaginary? In this course, we will question the premise that positions Shakespeare's play as offering a reflection of our own culture. In addition, we will consider the questions about who gets to write about and understand blackness, black people, and black experiences as we examine the literary and cultural intents and effects of Othello across the centuries. Beginning with Shakespeare, we will consider the way the play, its titular character, and anxieties about race and interracial desire haunt constructions of Africans, blackness, and African Americans in literature by a range of authors, British, American, Black, and White.

What does it mean to live the good life; to never experience lack or scarcity and to be surrounded by plenty? Can human societies realize such edenic conditions without the toil, labor, and suffering of others? How can a no-place be an ideal place? Is the ideal place for some people an injurious place for others? In addition to examining these questions, we will consider how political and critical theory bleed into utopian/dystopian texts, while also reflecting on how these texts interrogate and challenge those theories.

The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.  Students will be asked to pay a $15 course fee to cover the cost of a required safety whistle and a class t-shirt, to be donned by all students for all class sessions. Permission of instructor required."

 From colonial photography of the nineteenth-century to contemporary social media and artificial intelligence, photography has long been used as a tool to control, to police, to racialize, and oppress bodies of color. The camera, as a technology, is not an innocent or neutral bystander; rather, photography continues to play a crucial role in the maintenance of a social hegemony of whiteness. A new generation of BIPOC photographers, activists, artists, and poets are challenging, subverting, and highlighting some of the problems and paradoxes, as well as latent potentials of the medium in our current moment. This MCSI hybrid praxis/theory course will include a public series of interdisciplinary visiting artist lectures, readings, and performances that both contributes to Pitzer's Racial Justice Initiative, and engages with a broad range of students and disciplines across the college."

In the last decade, social media in particular has taken hold of people’s imagination and profoundly shapes lived experience and new understandings of the real. In this class, we will read anthropological texts on media to study the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated and consumed, with a special focus on new and social media. Students will learn how to conduct anthropological fieldwork, and will conduct semesterlong research projects into media worlds of their choice. This course brings anthropology’s cross-cultural perspective and attention to the production of everyday realities, looking at
the social, economic and political life of media in the constitution of local, national,diasporic and global subjectivities, collectivities, and histories in the contemporary world. By placing media cultures in comparative perspective, students will make the strange familiar and the familiar strange, enabling critical thinking about media use and its ramifications."

The method of distributing installments of a larger narrative over time has seen increasing prominence in a variety of media forms, ever since the birth of mass media and the serial novel in the mid-19th century. From the early film serials of The Perils of Pauline and Flash Gordon to Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from the popular radio serials of The Shadow and The Lone Ranger to true crime podcasts Serial and My Favorite Murder, from the development of the traditional network television series to the 'binge model' of Netflix, serial narrative has enabled complex longform storytelling and engaged and enraged audiences. But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience.

This introductory course presents a philosophical overview of the relationship between the pursuit of scientific knowledge, the development of technologies, and the expression of human values. In this class, students explore whether seemingly objective scientific inquiry can be affected by the social and cultural values of the scientific community. Broadly, we will focus on three inter-related topics: (i) evidence gathering and inductive reasoning, (ii) science as a value-free enterprise, and (iii) the nature of technological change through the explosion of big data and machine learning. Through these topics, we examine the values implicit in scientific culture and the extent to which these values do, can, and should guide the development of burgeoning technology."

the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the

Some people will, in the same breath, say that they believe in equality between the genders and that they arenâ€™t a feminist. Why might someone say something that's explicitly feminist while at the same time denying that they are a feminist? Why has feminism gotten such a bad rep? Feminismâ€™s â€˜bad repâ€™ may be owed to a number of complicated issues in the movementâ€™s past: failure to be inclusive of black women; failure to consider how intersectional oppression impacts feminist claims; and - the focus of this class - the worry that feminism has villainized men. This class will be an investigation into why men feel alienated and angered by feminism, and an exploration into how, if at all, feminism can benefit and empower men. Topics include the sex/gender distinction, the relationship between feminism and epistemology, analyses of gendered oppression, the patriarchy, male feminism, and toxic masculinity.

Aristotle defined us as "rational animals." Recent findings in experimental psychology seem to cast doubt on this presumption. We seem to systematically fail on simple reasoning tasks. If so, does it follow that humans are deeply irrational? The answer turns on just how we should understand the nature of human rationality. This course investigates both the epistemology and psychology of human judgment. P. Graham.

Students will learn how philosophers think about intuitions and the roles they play in grounding and challenging theories in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, etc. In addition, students will explore important intersections between philosophy and science, such as the emergence of neurophilosophy and moral psychology in the 20th century. The armchair isn't going anywhere, but neither is the question of which methods of inquiry, namely those empirically informed, are part of the philosopher's toolkit in addressing diverse questions about mind, knowledge, and morality.

The topic for Spring 2020 is "The Psychology of Bias" and its central question will be this: Do humans have objective, value-neutral access to information about the external world? Contemporary empirical work at the intersection of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science suggests pessimism about objectivity in perception, inference, and thought. Cases of so-called cognitive penetration, stereotype threat, and implicit bias appear to be cases where background beliefs about social stereotypes and prejudices might unconsciously change and shape the way we view the world around us, the beliefs we form about others, and how we navigate the social world. In this seminar, weâ€™ll address these issues head on and end by discussing the philosophical implications of these psychological phenomena in larger societal domains, including the fair treatment of marginalized groups in many aspects of the social world, in particular academia, machine learning, and the criminal justice system.

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility.  While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including "traditional" political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions.  Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as "hybrid effective governance," "heterarchy," "areas of limited statehood," "oligopolies of violence," and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.

Society needs more curious individuals like you. 

Please be aware, however, that this is not really what we’ll be thinking about in this class. “Politics” is in the title. I see that. But we’ll be thinking about politics in its broadest possible sense, as when Aristotle says that justice is an ordering of the soul, or when Kant argues that freedom is a moral quality. Before we get to the debating and voting and legislating, there is a vast, subterranean world of values that we must evaluate and order. This is the level at which we struggle to understand the nature of freedom and how it is achieved. It is where we face the challenge of directing our own lives and of discerning our obligations towards others. This is a political process. 

Why literature? Is there something that literary works can communicate that a more prosaic work of political theory cannot? Is there special political knowledge that eludes us when we remain on the level of newspapers, policy analysis, or journal articles? 

And what is literature anyway? If Gertrude Stein wrote down and published the results of Congress’s last roll-call vote, what then? 

Thus, defining “politics” broadly and lacking precise knowledge about where a mere aggregation of words end and literature begins, I have arranged this syllabus with the zeal of academic freedom (though not the license of tenure). I want to see what happens when we contemplate freedom, tyranny, obligation, inequality, oppression and war through literary mediums. Is the knowledge that results any different at all? If so, why? If not, why not?

We will focus our analysis on actors, structures, and issues with the following three fundamental questions in mind: who are the actors in the International Political scene? What are the systems or structural contexts within which these actors act, interact, compete, and/or cooperate? And finally, what are the issues that shape the patterns of cooperation and confrontation between these actors?

Traditionally, courses on International Relations focus predominantly on the interactions between states. However, in this course we will also examine the impact of local and transnational non-state organizations like terrorist organizations and private multinational companies on the relations among states and societies. After our review of various theoretical models of International Relations and identification of actors, systems, and issues, we will apply these conceptual frameworks to cases of conflict (wars), cooperation (EU, NAFTA, OPEC, APEC, Arab League), and revolutions (Russia 1917, China 1949, Cuba 1959, Iran 1979, Eastern Europe 1989/90) to see to what extent they are capable of explicating these questions: what are the roots of wars and why are states fighting each other? What is national interest? What is power and what are the conditions for its just and unjust use? What roles do regional and international civil society associations and human rights organizations play in policy-making? Why are there democratic states and non-democracies? What are the obstacles of democratization in different regions of the world? Why in spite of the impressive development of modern constitutions and institutions in the service of human rights and global peace do we still witness war, genocidal conflicts, and a systematic violation of human rights?

Football is now the world's most popular and lucrative sport, but how does it actually work?  The course examines the contemporary political economy, business models and governance of football, starting with the English Premier League, before broadening out to  look at a range of global football economies as well as the international politics and economics of sporting mega events.

There are three main components to the course. First a close examination of the political economy and cultural meanings of football in England and begins with the rise of the English Premier league - the richest and most watched football league I the world.  This section of the course will cover the business models of English football, the modelling of its markets, its place within a wider popular culture and its relationship to urban identities; and the complex politics of its governance. Second, the course will be comparative, taking the English model as a starting point and comparing it to the often very different political economy of the major European football nations, Latin America and Africa, and the new and rising powers of world football - East Asia, the Gulf and North America. The course will also compare football to other leading global sports in terms of both economics and governance. Third, the course will examine the global governance of football and the peculiar cultural significance and political economy of global sporting mega events.

The Fatimids, who controlled a large portion of the Mediterranean, brought about a number of remarkable achievements under their rule: the founding of Cairo; unprecedented ritual pageantry surrounding the leader, the caliph-imam; and major advancements in theology, arts, and sciences. In this course we will think through major issues in the way political philosophy helped to guide the empire—issues such as the role of apocalypticism as a revolutionary theology; the place of secrecy in governing; and how religious symbolism could explain declines in political power. As the Fatimids were Shia, we will also cover various similarities and differences between Sunni and Shia political philosophies.

We will also look at the ways in which these discourses and the identities they shore up can be "queered," as well as at biblical texts that can be read as queer friendly. This process of queering will allow and require us to approach the biblical text in new ways."

This course looks at religious practices, texts, and traditions that defy the usual assumption that religions insist on binary gender divisions and heteropatriarchal kinship models.  Along the way we question what we mean by "religion" and what we mean by "queer." We consider how sexualities and genders are shaped in and through religious practices, texts, and traditions. We consider the intersections of religion and sexuality with transnational politics, ethnicities, cultures, and power relations. We consider how religious traditions can push back on received norms and create space for queer gender expression, identity, and sexual practice. The course will pay particular attention to how we research and write about queer religious phenomena. Letter grade only. "

Yet what counts as "religion" or "politics" continues to be a point of conflict. Does politics imitate or even rival divine sovereignty? Is politics possible precisely because it is distinct from divine sovereignty? Does (and should) separation protect religion from politics or politics from religion? What do terms like "faith-based," "free exercise," "establishment," or "toleration" mean? Do religious discourses like prophesy or love of neighbor function as socio-political critiques or do they, instead, depoliticize injustice? We examine how these questions show up in Western thought, through theological works, political theory, court cases, current events, and debates on secularism. While focusing on Christianity and its legacy, we also examine the effects ofthese issues on Judaism and Islam in their confrontations with Christianity, on the one hand, and the rise of the "secular" nation-state, on the other."

In this study, we will consider various aesthetics such as the identity-transformative poetry of Pedro Pietri and Zora Neale Hurston, the past/future indigenous-driven music of Lila Downs and Beyonce, the cinematic reinterpretation of "Birth of a Nation" by DJ Shadow and Steven Knight's rendering of the infamous Birmingham gang the Peaky Blinders, and other plays, literature, philosophies, and theologies created by or about the "darker hues" from the Enlightenment until the present as they grapple with the consequences of modernity as shaped by European colonization. The course begins with definitions of "atheism" and the "darker hues." From those foundations, we will frame aesthetic rejections of Western Christianity by the "darker hues" as part and parcel with a disbelief in and rejection of that type of God as "atheistic," even if they are replaced by other theisms. The course will also define "aesthetic religion" and experiment with such an understanding to see if it fits the artists, works of art, and aesthetic movements in question. Lastly, we will encounter such aesthetically atheistic movements inside of the classroom in theory and outside of the classroom where they live and breath in places almost adjacent to our location in Claremont.

The genres of house, techno, drum and bass, glitch, hip-hop, trip-hop, dubstep, reggaeton, dancehall, and others all have strong roots in the continent of Africa and the Afro-diaspora (among other places). From these and various other roots that are "mashed up" and represented, the musical styles create alternate universes/futures within the existing "real" universe, and in that the creation, there is a religiosity that demands our attention. Drawing from Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and Brian Massumi's activist philosophy, we will consider how electronic music creates fluid, vibrant, and progressive communities that reshape how we understand certain "constants" in the world. The class will pay close attention to how electronic music articulates critiques against systems of power and how said critiques serve a religious function in the world. Students will listen to electronic music, attend shows amidst several electronic music communities, explore the contours of religious meaning in the genres, and learn this exciting and relatively unexplored corner of the religious studies landscape in very embodied ways.

and higher education with the study of mass schooling as a prominent element
of societies throughout the world over the last two centuries or so (since the
industrial revolution, roughly speaking). We will be particularly concerned with
the relationship between schooling, on the one hand, and global and local social
inequalities, processes of standardization (of languages and identities, for instance),
the composition of labor markets, and the entry of secular knowledge into everyday
habits of mind, on the other. Our goal is to use the investigation of schooling as
a social-historical phenomenon to expand and improve ongoing debates about
educational policies and practices. As part and parcel of the seminar, Student
Fellows will interact closely with visiting speakers and guests of the Center, and will

We begin with an introduction of the social roles of rituals, and how pregnancy symbolizes social cohesion for communities of color.

Through hands-on fermentation practice, microbiological culturing and analysis, readings, discussions, writings, and tastings, students will gain familiarity with the basic concepts and practices of microbiology and will engage ongoing debates in cultural geography, anthropology, and science and technology studies, about our human responsibilities in a more-than-human world."

The global reach of the fertility industry has leveraged differences in the policies governing these technologies across the world to develop markets for gametes, surrogates, and experimental procedures. Although these technologies have made fertility and reproduction to be accessible to new populations, they also raise concerns about the potential consequences they will have on both present and future generations. In this course we will explore the social, cultural, and ethical implications of reproductive technologies, while analyzing these considerations using sociological, bioethical, legal, and reproductive justice frameworks."

What kinds of expectations have been shaped about who gets to be a scientist and about the nature of scientific knowledge? For the final project, students will create a work of popular science in a genre of their choosing."

This assumption spurs the extensive introduction of numerical technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, into contemporary governance, policing, and marketing. Yet, numbers are produced by people. How do people decide what information should be numerically recorded? How do they choose how to interpret numbers? How do social and cultural contexts play into their decisions? Reading broadly across history, social science, law, cultural analysis, feminist, and critical race scholarship, we will tackle these questions by looking at the historical origins of numerical technologies and their contemporary social and ethical ramifications."

We will begin this course by examining the Early Modern and nineteenth century attempts to automate human cognition and will learn about alternative approaches to thinking about technology and the mind. As we proceed to the twentieth century, we will examine the racial and gender implications of contemporary definitions of intelligence and creativity and the ways they shape our present economies.

And what do the stories we tell convey about ourselves and our relationships to communities, including who we are not and how we want to be seen? In this writing course, we look at how identity is storied in literature in order to turn that lens back on ourselves as writers. How do we use our writing in everyday life to construct identities—even when writing about things other than ourselves? Why is our own writing so often a site of competing allegiances? And how do our identities as writers shift when we write in different contexts?

In this writing seminar, we investigate the cultural and communicative practices that define literacy in different educational settings. We begin by analyzing the literacy autobiographies of public intellectuals like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Mike Rose, before composing our own narratives about other people, perspectives, and institutions that have shaped our sense of ourselves as writers. Next, we draw on research from sociology, writing studies, and linguistics to reassess problematic representations of literacy in education policies and popular culture. For a capstone project, students write op-eds on an issue in education or literacy that interests them. Possible topics may include standardized tests and the college admissions process, language and identity, or the emergence of new literacies in the digital age."

Students will also have the opportunity to learn from peers by critiquing their written work. There will also be a midterm exam. 
A series of shorter analysis papers will culminate in a longer final paper that will require additional reading and research on a specific political or social issue. This paper should be based on a research question that is meaningful to you personally- something that you feel passionately about. You will investigate what respected scholars have had to say regarding this issue. After weighing the evidence presented within these sources, you will formulate your own position and express it in a scholarly way.

challenging? How do experienced writers build authority for their ideas? And finally, what roles can teachers and
tutors play in helping diverse learners develop as writers? Aimed at students tutoring in a writing center—or those
interested in teaching or tutoring writing in another context—this class is both theoretical and practical in its
orientation. All students observe sessions in the Writing Center and practice effective strategies for facilitating
collaborative learning. For the capstone project, students design a workshop and teaching tool that addresses a
writing or tutoring challenge."

Yet research shows us writing is a social practice developed through regular practice, challenging new tasks, and constructive feedback. In this seminar we investigate theories from writing studies to examine our own diverse experiences in writing. What does it mean to call something "good" writing? What ideological and cultural assumptions underwrite definitions? What can scholars tell us about why so many of us struggle with the writing process? And what are some strategies we can use to help ourselves and others grow as writers?

Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values
threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions. Assignments will likely include debates or mock trials on our main questions, analytical responses to the readings, workshops and reviews of classmates’ compositions, a mission statement for a liberal-arts college, and a defense or critique of a requirement at the Claremont colleges."

How do mentors, friends, assignments, and life experiences play a role in our development as writers? How has the pandemic affected the kind of writing we do and the purpose we find in it? In this seminar, we ask these questions by researching the college experience at The Claremont Colleges right nowâ€”in the middle of a pandemic, when many of us are working amidst 
profound disruptions and seeking ways to make knowledgeâ€making practices meaningful, collaborative, and engaged. Through surveys and interviews with Claremont students, we will produce original research about how this current 
generation of college students is finding its voice through writing. What kinds of writing inside and outside of the classroom are students doing? How do students report finding meaning in their work? What helps writers challenge 
themselves and grow? How do they manage setbacks or blocks? We will transform our findings into presentations for an academic conference and for Pitzer faculty and students so that others may benefit from the knowledge we coâ€create. Along the way, we will situate our findings in research from the fields of writing, sociology, and education. "
